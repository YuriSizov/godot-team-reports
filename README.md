# Godot Team Reports

This project is provided for Godot engine contributors to monitor stale
and old PRs and help clean up the review backlog.

## Contributing

This project is written in JavaScript and built using Node.JS. Generated content is completely
static and can be served from any web server without Node.JS. On the front end it uses
Web Components to achieve reactivity and interactivity without reliance on heavy UI libraries.

Further details on contributing will be added later.
